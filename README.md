Express Groomer is a website to connect groomers and pet owners. We want to make it easier for pet owners to find the perfect groomer near them. We also want groomers to be able to build their profile to find good matches. Our groomers will be able to specify what their preferences are, what skills they have, their contact information and to display examples of the work they've done. As for our pet owners they will be able to search groomers by location and specialty, they will also be able to save their favorite groomers for quicker access later.
